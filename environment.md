# Environment & setup

## A. Kaggle (primary, free)
1. Create a free Kaggle account; verify phone to unlock GPU.
2. New Notebook -> Settings -> Accelerator -> GPU T4 x2 (or P100).
3. Add your HuggingFace token as a Kaggle Secret named HF_TOKEN (free; needed to download models).
4. First cell:
   ```
   !git clone https://github.com/<you>/ac-rag-stack.git
   %cd ac-rag-stack
   !pip install -q sentence-transformers faiss-cpu bitsandbytes optimum-quanto pynvml
   ```
5. Quality sweeps (Phase 2) run fine here. Do NOT trust latency/energy numbers from Kaggle — shared, throttled.

## B. Local / RTX 4090 (later, for Phase 3 timing + energy)
```
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run timing/energy sweeps with nothing else on the GPU.

## Notes on "is it free / accessible"
- Every library above is open-source (MIT / Apache / BSD) and pip-installable.
- Models are Apache-2.0 and ungated (Qwen2.5) — no license-acceptance step, unlike Llama.
- A free HuggingFace token is only needed to pull model weights.

## Measured constants — Kaggle T4 (14.56 GiB), Qwen2.5-3B fp16

Phase 0 (1024-token stub, all-ones mask, full 32-step decode):
- weights resident 5.76–5.88 GiB (varies slightly by session)
- batch 32 peak 12.97–13.09 GiB; OOM at 48

Phase 1 (500 real HotpotQA top-k=5 prompts, batched left-padded):
- prompt tokens: mean 759, p50 742, p90 1000, p99 1189, max 1539
  (measured AFTER the exemplar system-prompt fix, which added ~31 tokens)
- batches pad to the batch maximum, so the binding constraint is max, not p99
- batch 40 peak 12.72 GiB OK; batch 48 OOM
- per-sequence cost is LOWER than the stub despite longer prompts: real
  answers hit EOS after ~3-5 tokens, so decode stops early and the KV cache
  never reaches max_new_tokens extent

generation.batch_size = 16 (frozen for all sweeps).
Batches must be fixed chunks of the example order — never length-sorted, since
knob changes would alter batch composition and contaminate the measured delta.
